# art-gallery-mock-website

This website uses React with React Hooks, Node, Express, and Material UI.
The goal is to create a website accessing MongoDB for "events" of an Art Gallery using React Hooks.
This project was created to explore the Material UI library along with learning React Hooks.

STILL IN PROGRESS. CAN BE VIEWED AT: https://art-gallery-mock.herokuapp.com/
